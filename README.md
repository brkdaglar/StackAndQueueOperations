# StackAndQueueOperations 

In this project, stack and queue impelement was made. 

In Queue.txt and stack.txt files initial states of queue and stack sent.

Convenience functions have been setup to perform operations on data using stack and queue. These operations are sent in command.txt file. 

Operations :

removeGreater(): In this method; pops or dequeue every element, adds to list if less than parameter and does not push or enqueue again if greater than value.

calculateDistance(): In this method; pops or dequeue every element, adds two to list, turns on a list to calculate the distance between each number and push or enqueue.

addOrRemove(): In this method; pops or dequeue if parameter less than zero, push or enqueue random elements if parameter greater than zero.

reverse(): In this method for stack; pops elements as many as parameter, reverse and again push. For queue; dequeue elements as many as parameter and adds to reverselist, dequeue 

other elements and adds to another list, enqueue backwards in reverselist and enqueue elements in the anotherlist.

sortElements(): In this method; pops or dequeue every element and add a list, sorts and enqueue or push.

distinctElements(): In this method; pops or dequeue every element and add removelist. If poppedValue (dequeueValue) not on the other list , add this list. The size of the list is 
distinct.

To the stackOut.txt and tailOut.txt files status after each operation sent.

Latest versions of stack and queue sent to stack.txt and queue.txt files
